This is a simple project by me to help me remember C.

It uses a backtracking algorithm to solve sodoku puzzled in the command line. Debug statements have been left in which leaves alot of output in the command line and slows the program down. The puzzles currently have to be entered into the code directly. I may try to change this. im not sure, although i think a gui is more suited to  python  ( i have written a similar solver in python).
